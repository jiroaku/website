# my journey

since i was very very young i fell in love with technology, phones and computers. back then i didn't know what programming was, so i was more into customizing everything, making android look like ios, creating youtube tutorials about how to install x program, that kind of stuff.

like the majority, i got interested in programming because of the idea of creating videogames. but i have to be honest, i gave up on that idea a long time ago haha.

## the beginning

at 16, i went to a vocational highschool to study software development. that's where everything changed. we started with c++ in the first year, which was rough but it taught me the fundamentals. second year we moved to c# mvc .net, and that's when i started to see how things actually work in the real world.

the final year was web dev, js and php. that's when i decided i wanted to be a web developer. something about building things that people could actually use and see immediately clicked with me.

## where i am now

fast forward to now, i'm 21, studying computer science (systems engineering), and i've shifted from web dev to backend and automation. i'm currently doing ccna to learn about networks, which has been eye-opening. understanding how data moves through networks is fascinating.

i cofounded tridnio studios and founded euxorasoft. i still do voice acting for minecraft events, which is fun and keeps me connected to the gaming community even though i'm not making games myself.

## what's next

i'm interested in low-level stuff, reverse engineering, cybersecurity, ai, and rust. there's so much to learn and explore. i primarily use windows on my desktop (college programs and gaming), but i'm running linux on two laptops, currently trying arch (omarchy) and ubuntu with omakube.

i normally use typescript for my web projects and java because of college. but i'm always experimenting, always learning.

the journey from customizing android phones to where i am now has been wild. and honestly, i'm just getting started.
